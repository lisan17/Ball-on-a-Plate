# Ball-on-a-Plate
This project implements basic concepts of PID Equation and Tuning to balance the ball on a one dimensional plate.

## Notes:-
1. To run the program you must have pygame, scipy and numpy installed. 
2. Use PyCharm for better experience.
3. After making sure that everything mentioned above is installed, run `python3 main.py`.
4. This will open a new window showing the plate and the ball.
5. You can click on the window to set the x-coordinate of the ball in the final position.
6. And you just saw a basic PID Controller.
